# Crypto-helper
1 key encoding/decoding

## Why have this
I am doing some crypto challenges this week. The challenges always have some encoded string and I need to guess the method to decode (eg. base64, md5, caesar, etc.)


## todo:
1. add the function of MD5 decryption
2. set it in my blog and build an api service for this tools
 

It's kinda waste time if I try it one by one, 

So I write a python script, which allows me to have a quick look of decoding results of the common encoding methods!

## Main function:
### function1: encode a string with different encoding methods!
